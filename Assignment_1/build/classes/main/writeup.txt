Please answer the writeup questions from the Karel
Writeup in this text file. You can then submit this 
file along with your code when using the submitter.

These questions will be graded on a "did you answer the
questions?" basis and your section leader may discuss
them with you during your IG for this assignment.

1. The Karel programs you wrote in the last three
   parts of this assignment need to work in a variety
   of worlds. How did you test your code to see if it
   would work correctly in multiple different worlds?
   
   

2. There are many different approaches you can take
   when writing your solutions to the CheckerboardKarel
   and MidpointFindingKarel problems. When you were
   working on these problems, did you consider any
   solution strategies other than the one you chose
   to implement? If so, what other approaches did
   you consider?
   
   

3. Choose one of the Karel problems other than
   CollectNewspaperKarel. Describe how you decomposed
   the program into smaller methods. How did you decide
   how to split the code across multiple methods? Did
   you consider any decompositions other than the one
   you ended up choosing?
