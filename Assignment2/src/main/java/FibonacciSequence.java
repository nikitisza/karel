 * This program is about to display the terms in the Fibonacci sequence, starting with Fib(0)
 and continuing as long as the terms are less than 10,000. The Fibonacci sequence
 In the 13th century, the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci—as a way to explain
 the geometric growth of a population of rabbits—devised a mathematical sequence that
 now bears his name. The first two terms in this sequence, Fib(0) and Fib(1), are 0 and 1,
 and every subsequent term is the sum of the preceding two.
