We'd love to get to know you in CS106A! As your first task, we'd like you to
update this document with the answers to the questions below and leave them in
your submission so that your section leader learn more about you (you probably
will not know who they are until after the assignment is due).

Also, send an email to Tom (hurlbutt@cs.stanford.edu), Yves
(yves@cs.stanford.edu), and Karl (knuhlig@stanford.edu) with the answers to
these questions. Please make sure that the subject line of your email says
"CS106A Email: <your name>", where "<your name>" is actually filled in with your
name.

General information and computing background:
	0.	What is your name?
	1.	What year are you? (Frosh, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Graduate, Other)
  2.  Are you a Stanford student, and if not where are you from?
	3.	What is your major/area of study (or, if you're in high school, what would you like to study)? ("I'm not sure" and "I don't know" are completely acceptable answers here!)
	4.	What type of computer (PC, Mac, Linux, etc.) do you prefer using?
	5.	Why are you taking CS106A?
Fun Stuff: This final section is just for us to have something to remember you by.
	1.	What do you do for fun?
	2.	Tell a quick anecdote about something that you feel makes you unique. This can be a cool talent, an interesting experience, or anything else you'd like!
	3.	Computers can be used to solve a wide variety of problems and perform a huge range of tasks. Is there any particular application of computers you'd like us to cover in this course?
